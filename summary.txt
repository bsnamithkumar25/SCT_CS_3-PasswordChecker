Project Title: Password Strength Checker – Python CLI Tool  
Internship: SkillCraft Cybersecurity Internship – Task 3  
Author: B S Namith Kumar  
Domain: Cybersecurity  

Summary:  
This project is a command-line based Python tool designed to assess the strength of user passwords. It evaluates each password based on five standard security criteria — length, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters — and categorizes the password strength from "Extremely Weak" to "Very Strong." The tool also provides actionable suggestions for improving weak passwords.

Core tools used include Python’s built-in `re` for regex-based validation and `argparse` for command-line interface handling. The program is modular, easy to integrate into larger applications, and helps users understand and follow secure password creation practices.

Key Highlights:
- No external libraries required
- Regex-based validation logic
- CLI with modular code structure
- Real-world application of password policy enforcement
